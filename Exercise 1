**Prompt**

Traditionally the first program in any programming course is the one where the system is made to print the words
"Hello World!", in one variation or another. So unsurprisingly the first programming exercise in this course does
exactly that. In the last pages of the chapter there were detailed instructions on how to test the interpreter
installation and make the first program, which printed some text. In this exercise, the aim is to replicate that example.

So in short, by following the instructions from the chapter, make a program which prints the following text:

Hello World!
This here is a Python program.

Also, remember to add the the code page definition to the source file, so that Python knows which language the code
was written in. That disclaimer can be for example this:

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

**Solution**

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

print("Hello World!")
print("This here is a Python program.")
