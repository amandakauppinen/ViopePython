**Prompt**

The third exercise in the chapter continues with the calculator exercises done earlier. This time the idea is to
finally take out the annoying problems with numbers, input validity and the stability problems caused by type
conversion funvtion.

Make the following changes to the calculator: Every time the user gives numbers to the program, the system asks
for the numbers with the prompt "Give a number: " and continues until a valid number is given. If the number is
not correct, the system gives an error message "This input is invalid.". If the calculator works correctly, it
prints out the following:

>>> 
Calculator
Give a number: hah, NEVER
This input is invalid.
Give a number: What?
This input is invalid.
Give a number: 100
Give a number: Just kidding
This input is invalid.
Give a number: 50
(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
(5)sin(number1/number2)
(6)cos(number1/number2)
(7)Change numbers
(8)Quit
Current numbers: 100 50
Please select something (1-6): 2
The result is: 50
(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
(5)sin(number1/number2)
(6)cos(number1/number2)
(7)Change numbers
(8)Quit
Current numbers: 100 50
Please select something (1-6): 8
Thank you!
>>> 

The easiest way of implementing this feature is probably to define a separate function to call when asking numbers.
In this function, an iteration keeps asking a number as long as the user decides to joke around. If the input is valid,
iteration terminates with break and the function returns an acceptable value

**Solution**

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

import math

def check() :
	while True:
		try:
			numberInput = int(input("Give a number: "))
			return numberInput
		except Exception:
			print("This input is invalid.")
	

print("Calculator")

number1 = check()
number2 = check()

number1 = int(number1)
number2 = int(number2)

while True :
	
	print(" (1) + \n (2) - \n (3) * \n (4) / \n (5) sin(number1/number2) \n (6) cos(number1/number2) \n (7) Change numbers \n (8) Quit")
	print("Current numbers: ",number1,number2)
	
	choice = input("Please select something (1-6): ")
	
	if not check :
		print("The input is invalid.")
	
	if choice == "1" :
		print("The result is: ",number1 + number2)
	
	elif choice == "2" :
		print("The result is: ",number1 - number2)
	
	elif choice == "3" :
		print("The result is: ",number1 * number2)
		
	elif choice == "4" :
		print("The result is: ",number1 / number2)
	
	elif choice == "5" :
		print("The result is: ",math.sin(number1 / number2))
	
	elif choice == "6" :
		print("The result is: ",math.cos(number1 / number2))
	
	elif choice == "7" :
		number1 = int(input("Give the first number: "))
		number2 = int(input("Give the second number: "))
		
	else :
		print("Thank you!")
		break
