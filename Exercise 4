**Prompt**

In this exercise the aim is to try out different datatypes. Start by defining two variables, and
assign the first variable the float value 10.6411. The second variable gets a string "Stringline!" as a value.


Convert the first variable to an integer, and multiply the variable with the string by 2. After this,
finalize the program to print out the results in the following way:

Integer conversion cannot do roundings: 10
Multiplying strings also causes trouble: Stringline!Stringline!

**Solution**

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

variable1 = 10.6411
variable2 = "Stringline!"

print("Integer conversion cannot do roundings:",int(variable1))
print("Multiplying strings also causes trouble:",variable2*2)
