**Prompt**

The first exercise in this chapter is an easy warm-up exercise to get things rolling.
The objective is to create a variable by giving it the correct name, and assign it the
string "string-type content" as a value. Then insert this variable into a print command
so that the program prints out following text:

Our variable has a value which is string-type content. Isn't that nice?
 

The trailing period can be added easily by editing the print command parameter sep. Other
changes, such as the situation with the aposthrope can be done in the string given to the print command.

**Solution**

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

variable = "string-type content"
print("Our variable has a value which is",variable,". Isn't that nice?")
