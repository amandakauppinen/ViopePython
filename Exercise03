**Prompt**

The second exercise continues with the basics of using variables. In this exercise,
define two variables and assign them values of 1000 and 24. After this, make the
interpreter do the calculation number1+number2+15 and then take the 2nd exponent (**2)
of the result. Save this final result to a new variable, and make the program print
the result in the following way:

The final results of the calculation was: 1079521

**Solution**

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

number1 = 1000
number2 = 24

number3 = ((number1 + number2 + 15)**2)

print("The final results of the calculation was:",number3)
