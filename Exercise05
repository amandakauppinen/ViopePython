**Prompt**

In this program the objective is to understand how the layout-characters (\t and \n} and print
in general works. By using only the print command, make the interpreter to print out the following text:
>>> 

This here is divided to several lines:
I am still in the same print-command.
	Name:	Peter
	Job:	Babysitter
>>> 

With the first two lines it is possible to just use the line break. On the latter two tabulation is also needed.

**Solution**

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

text = "This here is divided to several lines: \n I am still in the same print-command."
text2 = "\t Name: \t Peter \n \t Job: \t Babysitter"

print(text)
print(text2)
