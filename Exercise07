**Prompt**

The last exercise in this chapter focuses on string slices. Define a variable and
assign it a string "desserts" as a value. Then create three new variables, and assign
them values by slicing the A) first 4 characters B) the last 4 characters and C) the
entire string backwards as given values. Then make the program print the answers in
the following way:

The first 4 characters were: dess
The last 4 characters were: erts
The string backwards was: stressed

**Solution**

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

string = "desserts"
slice_1 = string[0:4]
slice_2 = string[4:8]
slice_3 = string[::-1]

print("The first 4 characters were: ",slice_1)
print("The last 4 characters were: ",slice_2)
print("The string backwards was: ",slice_3)
