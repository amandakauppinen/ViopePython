**Prompt**

The last exercise of chapter 5 continues the exercise made in the previous chapter. In
this exercise, expand the calculator so that the user can select what kind of calculation
is done. If the user chooses 1, the calculator does addition as earlier. If 2, the calculator
does substraction, if 3, it does multiplication, if 4, division.

Also add the instructions for the user to know what to do as shown in the example below.
Also, if the user selects anything else besides 1-4, the program prints "Selection was not
correct.". When working correctly, the progam looks like the following:

Calculator
Give the first number: 100
Give the second number: 25
(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
Please select something (1-4): 3
The result is: 2500

If the user selects something else besides 1-4, it prints the following:

Calculator
Give the first number: 320
Give the second number: 225
(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
Please select something (1-4): 100
Selection was not correct.

Errors such as the user giving input which is not a number, or division by 0, can be ignored at this point.

**Solution**

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

print("Calculator")

number1 = int(input("Give the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Give the second number: "))

print("(1) + \n (2) - \n (3) * \n (4) /")

selection = int(input("Please select something (1-4): "))

if selection == 1 :
	print("The result is: ",number1 + number2)
	
elif selection == 2 :
	print("The result is: ",number1 - number2)
	
elif selection == 3 :
	print("The result is: ",number1 * number2)
	
elif selection == 4 :
	print("The result is: ",number1 / number2)

else : print("Selection was not correct.")
