**Prompt**

The first exercise in this chapter consists of simple module library operations. In the chapter, a module
called random was introduced. This module consists of several functions which can be used to get random
numbers. The idea here is to create a program, which simulates coin flips by randomly selecting 0 (Tails)
or 1 (Heads) and printing out the result. When working correctly, the program prints out something like this:

>>> 
Heads!

Obviously, as the program applies random activities, it may give any combination of five heads or tails.
For example, running the program a second time resulted in this:

5 coin flips:
Tails!
Heads!
Heads!
Tails!
Heads!
>>>

**Solution**

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

import random

while True :
	number = random.randint(0,1)
	
	if number == 0 :
		print("Tails!")
		break
		
	else :
		print("Heads!")
		break
