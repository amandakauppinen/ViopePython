**Prompt**

The last exercise in this chapter adds a small feature to the other continuous exercise project, the notebook.
In this exercise, add a feature which includes the date and time of the written note to the program. The program
works as earlier, but saves data in the form "[note]:::[date and time]" meaning that there is a three-colon separator
between the note and timestamp. The timestamp can be generated as follows:

>>> import time		

>>> time.strftime("%X %x")
'19:01:34 01/03/09'
>>> 

This returns the date and time in a nice, compact string. When working correctly, the program prints the following:
			
>>> 
(1) Read the notebook
(2) Add note
(3) Empty the notebook
(4) Quit

Please select one: 2
Write a new note: Call mom.
(1) Read the notebook
(2) Add note
(3) Empty the notebook
(4) Quit

Please select one: 1
Call mom.:::11:44:41 04/25/11

(1) Read the notebook
(2) Add note
(3) Empty the notebook
(4) Quit

Please select one: 4
Notebook shutting down, thank you.
>>> 

**Solution**

# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

import time
	
while True:
	print(" (1) Read the notebook \n (2) Add note \n (3) Empty the notebook \n (4) Quit \n")
	
	selection = int(input("Please select one: "))
	
	if selection == 1 :
		myFile = open("notebook.txt","r")
		text = myFile.read()
		print(text)
		myFile.close()
	elif selection == 2 :
		userInput = input("Write a new note: ")
		userInput = userInput + ":::"
		userInput = userInput + time.strftime("%X %x")
		myFile = open("notebook.txt","a")
		myFile.write(userInput + "\n")
		myFile.close()
	elif selection == 3 :
		myFile = open("notebook.txt","w")
		myFile.close()
		print("Notes deleted.")
	elif selection == 4 :
		print("Notebook shutting down, thank you. \n")
		break
	else :
		print("Incorrect selection.")
